The project contains .exe files for ease of use. However, issues may arise. Here's some of the possible issues:
- Antivirus Detection: Some antivirus software may flag the executable as a potential threat. If this happens, you may need to whitelist the file.
- Missing Dependencies: The .exe file might not work on all systems due to missing dependencies or system-specific configurations.
- Windows Defender Warnings: Windows may warn that the file is from an unknown source. You can bypass this by selecting "More info" and then clicking "Run anyway."
- Compatibility Issues: The executable may not run on older versions of Windows or on systems missing required runtime components.

If you are trying to use the python version you need these liblaries:
- os
- sys
- tkinter
- pyttsx3
- threading
- PIL (pillow)
- google.generativeai (google-generativeai) #if you want to use the version that uses Gemini
